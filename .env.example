# --- AI Configuration ---
# Specify the Anthropic model to use.
# Examples: "claude-3-opus-20240229", "claude-3-sonnet-20240229", "claude-3-haiku-20240307"
DEFAULT_AI_MODEL="claude-3-sonnet-20240229"

# Maximum number of tokens the AI is allowed to generate in a single response.
# Anthropic SDK uses streaming, so this primarily guides the AI's output length.
# A very high value might still be constrained by the model's absolute output limits or overall context window.

# Context summarization settings (estimated token counts)
CONTEXT_TOKEN_HARD_LIMIT=180000 # Model's approximate absolute max context (e.g., Claude 3 Opus 200k)
CONTEXT_TOKEN_SOFT_LIMIT=150000 # Trigger summarization well before hard limit
SUMMARIZED_HISTORY_TARGET_TOKENS=20000 # Aim for summary to be around this many tokens
MIN_MESSAGES_TO_KEEP_BEFORE_SUMMARY=6 # Keep last N user/assistant turns (e.g., 3 pairs) before summarizing older parts


# --- Tool Configuration ---
# Default timeout for commands executed by CommandLineTool (in seconds)
DEFAULT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT=300 # 5 minutes

# Whether to require user confirmation before executing commands suggested by AI.
# Set to "False" to disable and allow AI to execute commands without explicit user 'yes'.
# Disabling this can be risky.

# Path for the log file. Directory will be created if it doesn't exist.

# Logging level for the console handler.
# Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
# Setting to WARNING or ERROR makes the console less verbose.
